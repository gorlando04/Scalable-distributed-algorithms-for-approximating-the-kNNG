# Results

We do not have a .csv here, because the NNDescentI/O experiments were different. So we stored the results in each Folder, and in the Table below we have a descriptions of the folders and the datasets inside it.

| Folder Name | Dataset | N_sample | Dimensions | Size (GB) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test0 | SK-1M-12d | 1.000.000 | 12 | 0.048 |
| Test1 | SK-10M-12d | 10.000.000 | 12 | 0.48 |
| Test2 | SK-20M-12d | 20.000.000 | 12 | 0.96 |
| Test3 | SK-30M-12d | 30.000.000 | 12 | 1.44 |
| Test4 | SK-40M-12d | 40.000.000 | 12 | 1.92 |
| Test5 | SK-50M-12d | 50.000.000 | 12 | 2.4 |



In each folder we have 2 files: Result.txt, Recall.txt. Result.txt file stores the time spent for building the kNNG, and  Recall file, store the recall of the approximate kNNG
